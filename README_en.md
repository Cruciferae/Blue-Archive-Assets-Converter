# Blue-Archive-Assets-Converter

translated by DeepL

## What is this?

In a nutshell, it reverts all the MediaPatches in Blue Archive back to their original format

The original MediaPatch folder is just a list of numbered files, but it changes them into a format that anyone can see

## Important

The tool needs MediaCatalog.bytes in MediaPatch folder to handle MediaPatch files,

but apparently the game deletes that file after initializing the data

To keep the MediaCatalog.bytes, you need to quit the game when the "Initialize Media Catalog" is around 99% after starting the game
