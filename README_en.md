# Blue-Archive-Assets-Converter

translated by DeepL

## What is this?

In a nutshell, it reverts all the MediaPatches in Blue Archive back to their original format

The original MediaPatch folder is just a list of numbered files, but it changes them into a format that anyone can see

## Important

The tool needs MediaCatalog.bytes in MediaPatch folder to handle MediaPatch files,

but apparently the game deletes that file after initializing the data

To leave MediaCatalog.bytes, you must exit the game during game initialization

If you exit the game when you are at the screen in the picture below, you should find MediaCatalog.bytes in MediaPatch folder
